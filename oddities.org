* Unixref
** Journal articles with duplicated identical publication dates.
** XSD lists "subtitle" element twice under "titles". 
   Is one potentially original language subtitle?

* Intentionally missing from unixref.clj
** DOI timestamps
** Some DOI resource collection info such as setById, multi-res lock/unlock, collection types
** SOme DOI resource item types - country and labelled
